# Building Blocks for Beautiful Cross-Platform Applications
This is the repo for my flutter talk at CodeMash. 

It contains the completed live coding demo and the settings file that contains the live templates that I used during the talk. 

The app will show you how to:

Customize and create UI
Handle click events with a button
Read data from text fields
Navigate and send parameters to another page
Make a networking request and handle the response
Display content in a list
Display an image from a networked URL
